                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I'm Callum Keogan — Senior Developer at Shopify. I keep the wheels of global commerce turning
                            by
                            day and wonder why my personal projects have so many TODOs by night.</p>
                        <p>With over 6 years in the industry, I'm currently working on the Checkout team at Shopify,
                            where
                            my work impacts millions of businesses across 175+ countries.</p>
                        <p>My developer journey has led me through various teams at Shopify, including leading
                            development
                            on the Shopify Forms app. What started with just two engineers grew to a team of 14 across
                            eight
                            countries. We built something that simultaneously improves merchant-customer connections
                            while
                            maintaining robust security within the Shopify ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>These days, I'm tackling architectural challenges on the Checkout team, re-platforming legacy
                            systems to enhance extensibility and integration capabilities. I've also done significant
                            work
                            integrating Draft Orders with other Shopify systems — building connections across our
                            platform
                            that make merchants' lives easier.</p>
                        <p>What drives me? I thrive on working across large, complex systems, crafting code that helps
                            real
                            people run their businesses more effectively, which is reflected in this terminal-inspired
                            site
                            where form follows function.</p>
                        <p>I'm passionate about creating applications that are both secure-by-design and respectful of
                            user
                            privacy. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me exploring trails with my dog.</p>

                        <h2>Technical Leadership</h2>
                        <p>At NE6, I served as Head of Development, managing project timelines and coordinating with
                            clients
                            to translate their requirements into technical solutions.</p>
                        <p>As one of the original developers on Shopify Forms, I witnessed and contributed to its growth
                            from 2 to 14 engineers across 8 countries, participating in the team's expansion while
                            maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.</p>
                        <p>I believe effective technical contributions come from understanding both the code and its
                            context—working alongside teammates to build solutions that address real business challenges
                            while maintaining engineering excellence.</p>
